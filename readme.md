###Jersey2 Generator

A simple script to generate Jersey2 projects (2.25 to be exact) requires Maven and Java 8, based on the <a href="https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/user-guide.html#new-webapp">Jersey2.25 User Guide</a>. Easier than passing a long list of options to mvn.

It's a .bat file just execute it wherever you want to generate your project. Add it to your PATH perhaps. Windows only for now. Batch version in the future, maybe.
